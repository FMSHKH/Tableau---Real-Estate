## 📌 Problem Statement  
The real estate market in King County, Washington, is dynamic and influenced by multiple housing features. Buyers, sellers, and investors can benefit from understanding the key factors that impact house prices.

This project uses Tableau to analyze historical house sales data and uncover patterns related to property characteristics such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area size, lot size, and year built.

## 📊 Data Description  
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following variables:

- **House Prices**: The sale price of each house (in USD).  
- **Bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms.  
- **Bathrooms**: Total number of bathrooms.  
- **Sqft Living**: Size of the interior living space (in square feet).  
- **Sqft Lot**: Total area of the land on which the house sits (in square feet).  
- **Yr Built**: The year the house was originally built.

## 📈 Dashboard Features  
This interactive Tableau dashboard provides:

- **Price Distribution Analysis**: Visual breakdown of how house prices vary across different property characteristics.
- **Bedrooms & Bathrooms Impact**: Insights into how the number of bedrooms and bathrooms influences pricing.
- **Living Space & Lot Size**: Relationship between house size, land size, and final sale price.
- **Year Built Analysis**: Examination of how the construction year relates to house value.
- **Interactive Filters**: Filter by bedrooms, bathrooms, or year built to explore targeted trends.

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Living Space Matters**: Houses with larger living areas generally command higher prices.
- **Bathrooms Over Bedrooms**: The number of bathrooms appears to have a stronger influence on price than bedrooms.
- **Lot Size**: While important, lot size alone is less correlated with price unless paired with a large living area.
- **Older vs Newer Homes**: Newer homes (built after 2000) tend to be priced higher, though some older, well-maintained homes also retain high value.
